# Prisma supports the native connection string format for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, MongoDB and CockroachDB.
# See the documentation for all the connection string options: https://pris.ly/d/connection-strings

# The following `prisma+postgres` URL is similar to the URL produced by running a local Prisma Postgres
# server with the `prisma dev` CLI command, when not choosing any non-default ports or settings. The API key, unlike the
# one found in a remote Prisma Postgres URL, does not contain any sensitive information.
